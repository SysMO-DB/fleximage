= Fleximage

This is a modified version of https://github.com/Squeegy/fleximage that has been adapted to work as a Gem in Rails 3.
Note however, it has been shoehorned into a Gem, and only works for the parts we need for http://www.seek4science.org - which includes acts_as_fleximage and image resizing.
